# Poke Battle Quiz Wiki Index

## Direction

- **What:** a daily Pokemon-themed deduction quiz where everyone solves the same
  Pokemon answer.
- **How:** players reveal information through battle-like commands instead of
  free-form questions.
- **Engine boundary:** the MVP uses a deterministic quiz hint engine, not a full
  battle simulator.
- **State boundary:** MVP progress and personal stats can start in localStorage.
- **Knowledge boundary:** raw PRD/ADR/notes files are the source of truth; this
  index is only navigation.

## Maintenance

- Add new raw work units under `docs/raw/{feature,bugfix,chore}/branch-slug/`,
  derived from branches like `feature/main-layout`.
- Feature units should normally include `prd.md`, `adr.md`, and optional
  `notes.md`.
- Bugfix and chore units may use `notes.md` only, unless a durable decision needs
  an ADR.
- When a raw unit is added, run `npm run harness:ingest -- docs/raw/<type>/<slug>`
  to add exactly one navigation line here under the best category.
- Add new `docs/wiki/*.md` pages only after an accepted raw ADR says the index is
  no longer enough.
